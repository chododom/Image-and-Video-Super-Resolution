# Video Super Resolution Using Neural Networks
Author: Dominik Chodounsk√Ω

This project was created as part of the course NI-MVI (Computational Intelligence Methods) at FIT CTU in Prague.

Its aim is to take a short low-resolution video and use deep learning techniques to upscale the video resolution via synthetic generation.

The current progress of the project can be seen in the [milestone report](/milestone_report.pdf).

Some examples of results of single image super resolutoin achieved by my adaptation of the U-Net architecture can be seen in [this](/plots) folder.
